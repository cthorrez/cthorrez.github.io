                <h3>Fun Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    Occasionally in my free time I work on small side projects where I can apply statistics, python, machine learning, or miscelaneous data science related things to explore a topic that I find personally interesting or amusing. 
                </p>

                <h4><a href="ml-fun/kmeans_gd/index.html"><h4>K-means using Gradient Optimization</h4></a></h4>
                <p>
                    While the common K-means clustering algorithm is one of the simplest algorithms in machine learning, the K-means loss function can also be optimized by gradient descent and the standard algorithm is closely related to Newton's method of optimization. In this project I derived, implemented, and experimented with three different ways of minimizing the k-means loss function. <a href="ml-fun/kmeans_gd/index.html"> [writeup]</a> <a href="https://github.com/cthorrez/ml-fun/tree/master/kmeans_gd"> [code] </a>

                <h4><a href="pi_from_hypothesis_testing/index.html"><h4>Pi From Hypothsis Testing</h4></a></h4>
                <p>
                    I learned in a stats class that there are particular geometric properties ingrained within the Z and Wald statistical hypothesis tests. This project exploits this geometry and estimates the value of pi to a high degree by monte carlo sampling data sets, fitting OLS regression on them, performing hypothesis tests on the coefficients, and comparing the ratio of test acceptances. <a href="pi_from_hypothesis_testing/index.html"> [writeup]</a> <a href="https://github.com/cthorrez/pi_from_hypothesis_testing"> [code]</a>

                <p>
                    I read on reddit that LeBron James had averaged 27 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for 15 seasons but had never completed one game with exactly those statistics. I attempted to model his statistics and calcualte the probability of that never happening. <a href="lebron_27_7_7/index.html"> [writeup]</a> <a href="https://github.com/cthorrez/lebron_27_7_7"> [code]</a>
