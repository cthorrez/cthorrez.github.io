                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Clayton and I like machine learning. I studied ML at UMich and UMass, I've worked in ML at various places, and currently do so at Microsoft (my opinions are my own). Sometimes in my free time I work on ML stuff for fun. My experience spans natural language processing, reinforcement learning, rating systems, computer vision, and robotics. In my free time I do data science stuff in <a href="https://www.esportsds.com/">esports</a>.
