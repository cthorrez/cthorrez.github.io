I like rating systems research. What are rating systems? Rating systems are systems for assigning ratings to "things" representing how "good" they are in comparison to other "things". The most common examples are in competitions like sports or chess, where each team or player gets assigned a number representing their strength, the higher the number, the better they are. Rating systems are just the different ways to get those numbers.
